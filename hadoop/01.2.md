#### 错误提示（２）

````
Exception:

Exception in thread "main" org.apache.hadoop.ipc.RemoteException(java.io.IOException): File /test222.xml could only be replicated to 0 nodes instead of minReplication (=1).  There are 1 datanode(s) running and 1 node(s) are excluded in this operation.


Reason:

If you are sure the capacity of data node is not exhausted and the communication between master node and data node is working well, then the issue may be caused by url resolving. Specifically, HDFS client cannot connect to datanode, although it can be connected with master node.
````

#### 解决办法

```java
//add following configuration on the org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration instance:

Configuration conf = new Configuration();
conf.set("dfs.client.use.datanode.hostname", "true");

```

```txt
confirm your client could ping datanode
E.g. datanode host name: quickstart.cloudera
If ping is failed, then add resolving mapping manually.
1) In Mac OS, use following command to edit ＃hosts file.

sudo vi /private/etc/hosts

add following mapping to the file.

127.0.0.1       quickstart.cloudera
```
